# Revenue-Expense-Surprise-on-Return

The purpose of this project is to replicate and write about my findings of Ertimur et al. (2003), titled Differential Market Reactions to Revenue and Expense Surprises.


The paper is written in 2003, so much of the findings are out of date. Part of this project is to look at the current market and see if the findings hold true. I will use current data and compare my results to their findings.
